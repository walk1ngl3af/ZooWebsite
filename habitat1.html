<h1>The Savannah</h1>
<p>Savannahs are flat grasslands with sparse shrubs and trees. The temperature is warm year round due to receiving more sunlight than any other environment. Savannahs only have 2 seasons, wet and dry. The wet season, or monsoon season, has 50-120cm of rainfall. There are several efficient predators in the savannah. Two of the best are the <strong>Cheetahs</strong> and <strong>African Wild Dogs.</strong></p>

<p>Cheetahs are the fastest animal in the world able to reach speeds of up to 112 kph! Nearly all cheetahs can be found in sub-Saharan Africa, however they can also be found in northeastern Iran.<br> There are only a few dozen that reside there. These beautiful feline predators have a pale yellow coat with black dots on the upper parts, and are white on the underbelly.<br> Their faces can be distinguished by distinctive black lines from the inner corner of each eye to the outer corners of the mouth.</p>

<p>An African Wild Dog is one of the most efficient predators on Earth. In a pack, they are even more dangerous. These animals travel in packs as small as 10, to as big as 40.<br> These animals are pack predators hunting antelope, gazelle, and even wildebeasts. These dogs can sprint at speeds of 70 mph. These efficient predators are endangered.</p>
