<h1>The Desert</h1>
<p>Deserts are one of the most hostile environments on Earth. They have some of the hottest days, and coldest nights. Deserts don't get much rain, resulting in a very dry landscape. Due to this lack of water, animals and plants that reside here have adapted to conserve water and keep their bodies from giving in to the scorching heat. One third of the world's surface is covered in deserts. Some animals that have adapted to this harsh environment are the <strong>Fennec Fox</strong> and the <strong>Elf Owl</strong>.</p>

<p>Fennec Foxes are fairly tiny with big ears. The purpose of these ears is to regulate heat and locate underground prey. The Fennec Fox is the smallest of the fox species.<br> Every aspect of this creature has adapted to the harsh desert environment. You will usually find this small fox in the Western Sahara and other harsh environments.<br> The Fennec fox has a sand-colored fur which reflects sunlight, a black nose, a tapering tail with a black tip, and long ears with longitudinal reddish stripes on the<br> back and have hair on the inside of its ear.</p>

<p>The Elf Owl is the smallest raptor. This small creature lives in dry thorn forests, deserts, and pine-oak forests.<br> These owls live in old woodpecker holes or small caveties that provide relief from the scorching heat.<br> During the cold nights, the Elf Owl hunts small insects and gives puppylike calls to mark its territory. </p>
