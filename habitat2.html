<h1>The Forest</h1>
<p>The forests of California, Canada, and around the globe are very diverse. They have so many animals, but if I were to pick my favorites. They would be the wolves and lynxes of the forests. There are three types of forests that cover, in total, around 1/3 of Earth's surface. Temperate, Boreal, and Tropical. Temperatures and weather vary depending on which type of forest you are in. Tropical forests tend to have lots of precipitation (Rain) and high temperatures. On the other hand, Boreal forests tend to have below freezing temperatures while temperate forests have around average temperatures. </p>

<p>Wolves are some of the coolest and dangerous animals you can come across in a forest. At one point in time, your dog's bloodline looked just like the picture above. <br>Wolves live in packs that can be as small as 2 to as big as 15. Wolves communicate through several methods such as body language, barking, growling, scent marking, and some other methods.<br> A fun fact about wolves is that they don't actually howl at the moon. They howl to solidify pack bonds or to warn other packs to stay away.<br> <br>For more information, click this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Mammals/Gray-Wolf">link to NWF</a></p>

<p>Lynxes are as stealthy as a jaguar and as quiet as a mouse. There are 4 main species of lynx however at one point there were believed to be 5. <br> These 4 species of lynx are the Eurasian Lynx, Canada Lynx, Iberian Lynx, and the Bobcat. Lynxes have a short tail, black hair on the tips of their ears,<br> large, padded paws, and long whiskers on their face. Fur color from range from goldish all the way to beige-white. The lynx, unlike the wolf, is<br> a solitary animal and they dwell in high altitude forests. These animals can be found in the boreal and temperate forests.<br> <br>For more information, click this <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx">link to Wikipedia</a></p>
