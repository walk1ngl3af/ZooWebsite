<h1>The Tundra</h1>
<p>The tundra is a freezing environment, one of the coldest on the planet and only a few resilient animals can live here. Most of the animals diets consist of dead plants or animals. Two of my favorite animals that are resilient enough to live here are the <strong>European Polecat</strong> and the <strong>Snow Leopard</strong> </p>

<h2>European Polecat</h2>

<p>Ferrets aren't found in the wild, but their closest non-domesticated cousin is. These non-domesticated ferrets tend to have a weasel-like appearance.<br> These cute creatures have small, round eyes, short legs, a cylindrical. These small weasels can eat rodents, rabbits, eggs, birds, and amphibians. I wonder what a frog tastes like.</p>

<h2>Snow Leopard</h2>

<p>These beautiful creatures are the apex predator in this environment. Sadly, though they are endangered.<br> Their natural snow-white coat is spotted with black dots to the point where even technology has a<br> hard time picking them out. Its powerful build allows it to traverse mountains with such precision similar<br> to a mountain coat. This cat can leap SIX TIMES its body length. </p>
