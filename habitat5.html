<h1>The Rainforest</h1>
<p>The Rainforest is one of the most diverse environments on Earth. They tend to be hot and moist and they typically see 2,000 inches of rain! There are two types of rainforests, tropical and temperate. If I were to pick 2 out of the many animals there, I would pick the <strong>Jaguar</strong> and the <strong>Giant Otter</strong>.</p>

<p>The Jaguar is a mighty cat who survives in the rainforest. These predators are the 3rd largest cat in the world and can weigh over 300 pounds. These cats are strong swimmers and climbers. Too bad my cat isn't.</p>

<h2>Giant Otters</h2>

<p>Despite what normal otters in the zoo might show you, the Giant Otter is a vicious predator. In a group, even alligators or jaguars won't enter their territory. Sometime they take down caiman, snakes, alligators, or even the unfortunate jaguar that fell into the river.</p>
